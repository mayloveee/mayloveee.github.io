    and two common values of the method attributes are post and get.
    get: is usually considered to be insecure. it's going to append 
    your data to the URL of your webpage. show in browser, it going to show everything in the URL.
    if you need to store secure information, like a password, do not use GET.
    it's useful for search box.  post is better for secure information (but we do not have a server set up now).

    since we are embedding another web page within our
    webpage, a common hacking technique is that you can 
    have this embedded webpage take up the entire frame of
    your HTML document. Your website could pose another website,
    which could be dangerous. For instance, if you embed bank of America website 
    and somebody visit your website, then type in their banking info
    like their login credentials, and you could capture that (bing works)-->
